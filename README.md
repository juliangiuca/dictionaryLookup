# Dictionary domain search

This Node app goes through every word in the OS X dictionary, and performs a whois lookup for the .com of that word.

## How to run:
```
npm install
```
then
```
node app.js
```

## And then...?
After you've run the script, you should see a words.txt file with every available .com domain
